# AGENTS.md — YatraFlow

Operating manual for AI coding agents (Cline and friends) working in this repo.
Read it fully before starting work. Follow the rules. **Keep this file growing.**

## 0. The learning rule (this file must grow)

Any crucial learning made while working here — a pitfall that cost debugging
time, a project quirk, a convention the user cares about, a "local lied, CI was
right" moment — **must be recorded in this file in the same session it was
learned**, as a short actionable rule in the most relevant section below.
Before committing, ask: *"did this session teach something a fresh session
would need?"* If yes, add it here and include the update in the same commit.
Prune entries that stop being true.

## 1. What this project is

YatraFlow — collaborative India trip-planning app. React 18 + Vite 8 +
TypeScript, Supabase (auth + data), MapLibre GL maps, hash-based routing,
deployed on Vercel from `main`. No bookings/payments — planning only.

Key locations:
- `src/App.tsx` — app shell: hash routes, nav (hamburger ≤720px), theme, notifications
- `src/store/store.ts` — data layer (`useSyncExternalStore`) over Supabase
- `src/lib/engine.ts` — pure planning engine (schedule, budget, breaks, warnings)
- `src/lib/geocode.ts` — provider facade: Google-first (opt-in key), free-stack fallback
- `src/lib/providers/` — `google.ts`, `free.ts` (OSM/Wikipedia/Mappls), shared hits logic
- `src/lib/timefmt.ts` — 12h/24h clock preference + formatters (default 12h)
- `src/lib/uiPrefs.ts` — per-day collapse persistence (localStorage)
- `src/components/TripMap.tsx` — MapLibre map (lazy chunk); `src/components/mapcn/` wrapper
- `src/pages/TripWorkspace.tsx` — the big one: tabs (timeline, map, budget, share…)
- `tests/` — vitest in **node env (no DOM)** — test pure logic, not DOM
- CHANGELOG.md — Keep-a-Changelog-style; versions are pre-1.0 milestones

## 2. Workflow rules (non-negotiable, user-mandated)

1. **Never push to `main` without the user's explicit confirmation** — commit
   locally, then ask.
2. **Every push ships documentation**: CHANGELOG.md entry in the same commit
   (under `[Unreleased]`, or a versioned section for releases). Feature-worthy
   releases also bump `package.json` + lockfile version and update README.
3. Fixes and features get changelog entries with enough context to understand
   them six months later.
4. **Another agent may commit into this same working copy** — Hermes has
   dropped doc commits directly onto local `test` (an uncorrected duplicate
   of its own PR branch). Before trusting or pushing a local branch, run
   `git status -sb` and `git log origin/<branch>..<branch>`; reconcile
   foreign unpushed commits (reset/supersede **with user approval**) rather
   than shipping them.

## 3. Verification before every push

Use `npm run verify` — it runs the full gate:
`tsc -b --clean` → fresh typecheck → full test suite → production build.

Hard rules (each learned the hard way — do not relearn them):
- **Bare commands only.** NEVER verify with `cmd /c "... & echo %ERRORLEVEL%"`.
  `cmd` expands `%ERRORLEVEL%` **at parse time, before the commands run**, so it
  echoes a stale exit code and masks real failures. This caused repeated
  "local passes / Vercel fails" drift (Aug 2026, twice).
- **PowerShell: a bare `echo;` (no argument) prompts for `InputObject` and hangs
  captured output** — always pass an argument (`echo '---'` / `Write-Host "…"`).
  The terminal looks stuck and shell-integration reports the command as still
  running (cost debugging time fetching `gh issue view` bodies, Aug 2026).
- **`tsc -b --clean` first** in any session before trusting a typecheck —
  incremental build caches pass code that clean builds reject.
- If Vercel's deploy fails, reproduce locally with `npm run build` (the exact
  Vercel command: `tsc -b && vite build`), not `tsc` alone.
- `npm warn allow-scripts` about esbuild is a **warning, not a failure**; it's
  allowlisted via `allowScripts` in package.json.
- **Never fetch with a wildcard refspec** (`git fetch origin
  '+refs/*:refs/remotes/origin/*'`) — it remaps `refs/heads/*` to
  `refs/remotes/origin/heads/*` and **deletes** `origin/main`, `origin/test`
  and PR-tracking refs, so `origin/main` becomes "not a valid object name".
  Use plain `git fetch origin [--prune]`; to grab a PR, use
  `gh pr checkout <n>` or `git fetch origin pull/<n>/head`.
- **Never run dependent git checks as parallel shell calls** — during the PR
  audit, a ref-rewriting fetch raced a `merge-base --is-ancestor` check and
  returned contradictory results. Sequence dependent git commands in one call,
  and confirm merges via `gh pr view <n> --json mergeCommit` +
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor <mergeCommit> origin/main` (exit 0 = merged),
  not by eyeballing short `git log` windows.
- **CSS breakage is invisible to `tsc` + tests — only the full `vite build`
  sees it** (issue #14): a dangling declaration + stray `}` passed the
  typecheck and all 128 tests while vite 5 logged it as a mere minify
  *warning* for an entire release; a vite upgrade turned that warning into a
  hard error. Treat ANY minify warning in build output as a latent build
  blocker and fix it in the same pass. Related: junk dependencies can sneak
  into package.json from accidental installs (the `"24": "^0.0.0"` of
  issue #19) — review dependency diffs before committing. Since the vite 8
  upgrade, `@vitejs/plugin-react` must be v6+ (native vite 8 peers);
  plugin-react 4.x triggers ERESOLVE — the temporary `.npmrc`
  `legacy-peer-deps` pin was removed once v6 landed (0.19.0).

## 4. Code conventions & pitfalls

- **Data model**: times are always stored as 24h `"HH:MM"` strings. Format at
  render with `formatHM`/`formatHMRange` + `useTimeFormat()` from
  `lib/timefmt.ts`. 12h is the default; 24h is a user setting (Profile page).
- **Optional fields are `string | undefined`** (`closeTime`, `openTime`,
  `departTime`, …). Helpers must type their params for the data model's real
  shape, not the happy-path call site — a helper requiring bare `string` turned
  into a Vercel-only build failure.
- Browser-native `<input type="time">` follows the OS format **by design** and
  cannot be forced to 12h — don't replace it. The convention: keep the native
  input and echo the app preference as a live `.time-preview` ("= 6:30 PM")
  under it (see StopEditor / timefmt).
- **Mobile**: breakpoint is **720px**; mobile CSS lives in the single
  `@media (max-width: 720px)` block at the end of `src/styles.css`; keep touch
  targets ≥40px; inputs 16px on mobile (iOS Safari zooms smaller ones).
- **MapLibre/mapcn**: don't import `maplibre-gl` types directly in components —
  use the structural-cast pattern (`GeoJSONSourceLike` in TripMap.tsx).
- **Basemaps are OpenFreeMap (keyless, commercial-OK) — never reintroduce CARTO
  or Esri tiles.** `mapcn/map.tsx` `defaultStyles` =
  `https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/{positron,dark}`. Their `style.json`
  ships **without** `sources.*.attribution`, so MapLibre renders no credit on its
  own — the OSM/OpenMapTiles license requires the `BASEMAP_ATTRIBUTION` string
  passed as `attributionControl.customAttribution`. Do **not** "switch to OSM
  raster tiles": `tile.openstreetmap.org` is a different look, has no dark
  variant, and its usage policy discourages production apps.
- **`noUnusedLocals: false` lets dead provider URLs rot in the tree** — four
  unused CARTO/Esri style constants sat in `TripMap.tsx` (with a comment
  describing a satellite toggle that never existed in the UI) and were a live
  licensing exposure in a file nobody was reading. When auditing third-party
  usage, grep for the **URL strings**, not just call sites.
- **HTML5 drag-and-drop does not work on touch devices** (no `dragstart`).
  The convention: keep HTML5 DnD for desktop, and route touch through the
  long-press pointer engine in `lib/touchDnd.ts` (integrated via `useReorder`).
  Any new drag surface must add both paths or explicitly opt out.
- **View prefs pattern**: per-object UI preferences (day collapse
  `yatraflow_day_collapsed`, hidden ride hints `yatraflow_ride_hints_hidden`,
  clock format `yatraflow_time_format`) live in localStorage via
  `lib/uiPrefs.ts`/`lib/timefmt.ts` — failure-tolerant maps of booleans keyed
  `"<tripId>:<dayIndex>"`, never trip data.
- `dev.log` is untracked local clutter — ignore it, never commit it. (It **did** get committed in `f09aaf9` when a bulk `git add` in this shared working copy swept it up — and the commit was pushed, so removing it needed a follow-up untrack commit. Stage explicit paths only; never `git add -A` / `git add .` here.)
- Test style: pure logic only, node env; mock `fetch` with route tables
  (`tests/providers.test.ts` has the pattern); `vi.stubEnv` for API keys.
- **Section-restructure edits can silently swallow bullets** — an edit whose
  `old_text` spans `<heading>` + its bullets + the next `<heading>`, replaced
  by just the next heading, **deletes the bullets**, not only the heading.
  After any heading-level restructure (CHANGELOG releases especially),
  re-grep all headings and re-read the affected range before trusting it.
  (The 0.18.0 restructure briefly lost four Fixed bullets this way.)
- **GitHub markdown links resolve from the file's own directory** — a
  root-level file links `docs/X.md` (never `../docs/`), files in `docs/`
  need `../` to reach root files like `DESIGN_TOKENS.md`, and emoji
  headings anchor with a leading dash (`## 🚀 Getting started` →
  `#-getting-started`). PR #25 shipped four broken links this way — check
  every link target against the tree before merging doc changes.

## 5. External services

Supabase (auth/data) · Vercel (auto-deploy from `main`) · Google Places
(opt-in key, quota-guarded, always falls back to the free stack) · OSRM ·
Open-Meteo · Mappls · **OpenFreeMap** (basemap tiles — keyless, no request
limits, commercial-OK; attribution must stay injected, see §4). Live probe for
Google: `scripts/verify-google-places.mjs`.
When touching provider code, keep the facade contract: Google failure or
absent key must silently fall back to the free stack.

Applying `supabase/schema.sql` DDL: the Dashboard SQL editor can run inside a
**read-only transaction** — DDL like `ALTER PUBLICATION` then fails with
`cannot execute … in a read-only transaction` (typical causes: the disk-full
read-only flip on the free tier, or a replica-routed session). Manage realtime
publications via **Dashboard → Database → Publications** instead (the UI
mutates through the management plane, not your SQL session), and verify live
membership with a plain SELECT (always allowed):
`select * from pg_publication_tables where pubname = 'supabase_realtime';`
No-SQL alternative: subscribe a `postgres_changes` channel per table with the
public anon key — Realtime rejects non-published tables at SUBSCRIBE time, so
a `SUBSCRIBED` status is functional proof of membership (verified all 8 tables
PASS this way after the #18 `profiles` toggle).
