# YatraFlow — Monetisation Plan

**Date:** 2026-09-15 · **Product:** `v0.54.0` · **Revenue to date:** ₹0

A dedicated commercial design document. `YatraFlow-Report-v3.md` covers the business and the
staged roadmap; this one goes deep on the money — pricing, fee mechanics, tax incidence, the
data model, conversion mechanics, and failure modes.

Every figure is tagged: **[MEASURED]** read from the repo or a public source ·
**[DERIVED]** arithmetic on measured values · **[ASSUMPTION]** a stated guess ·
**[UNKNOWN]** not known · **[DECISION]** a choice to make.

---

## 0. Two corrections to the record

Both matter before any pricing discussion.

**0.1 The "seed guard" is not a blocker.** Earlier versions of this analysis called the
`store.ts:600` demo-seed defect an open blocker on charging. The code disproves it:
`tripCountUnknown` is set when the memberships read fails and the seed is skipped unless the
trip count is trustworthy (`store.ts:630`, issue `#94`) **[MEASURED]**. The roadmap's prose was
stale; the code was right. Nothing about account integrity stands in the way of taking money.

**0.2 The AI companion is not an LLM.** `src/lib/ai.ts` describes it as *"Deterministic,
trip-data-grounded assistant. No live data claims — every answer cites the assumptions it
used."* `answerQuestion(trip, question)` is a pure function over trip data with no network call
**[MEASURED]**. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` lists *"Rule-based AI → LLM with engine grounding"* as a
future swap-in **[MEASURED]**.

This is the single most important fact for pricing the companion, and section 2 explains why: a
deterministic function has **zero marginal cost**, and an LLM has **real per-query cost**. They
are not the same product and cannot be priced the same way.

## 1. Starting position: the monetisation surface is built

An inventory of what already exists, because it determines how cheap Stage 2 is.

| Component | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Unlock price points | **Chosen** — ₹149 / ₹199 / ₹249 / ₹499 | `src/data/seed.ts` **[MEASURED]** |
| `premiumPriceInr` on the publication | Ships, commented *"placeholder for future payments"* | `src/data/types.ts` **[MEASURED]** |
| Free/paid split per publication | **`freeDayIndexes: number[]`** — which days are free | `src/data/types.ts` **[MEASURED]** |
| Locked-day UX | Blurred preview of the **first 3 stops** + *"N more stops on this day"* + *"Unlock the full day-by-day plan with stay contacts, timings and budget breakdown"* | `PublicItinerary.tsx` **[MEASURED]** |
| Unlock CTAs | **Two** — inline on the locked day, and a sticky sidebar button | `PublicItinerary.tsx` **[MEASURED]** |
| Per-publication custom CTA | `subscriberCta?: string` | `src/data/types.ts` **[MEASURED]** |
| Fork behaviour | Copies **only the free preview**; locked days arrive as fill-in placeholders | `PublicItinerary.tsx` **[MEASURED]** |
| Anonymous save | localStorage, **no account required**, device-local | `src/lib/savedPubs.ts` **[MEASURED]** |
| Creator hub | Publications manager, stats, unpublish, stale-page nudge | `CreatorHubPage.tsx`, v0.37/v0.38 **[MEASURED]** |
| Earnings ledger | Ships with its **final** column shape: Payout period · Sales · Platform fee · Net payout | `ARCHITECTURE.md` **[MEASURED]** |
| Projection view | `projectEarnings()`, labelled *"never money"* | `src/lib/earnings.ts` **[MEASURED]** |
| Fee seam | `PROJECTED_PLATFORM_FEE_INR = 0` — *"the seam where the real fee model plugs in"* | `src/lib/earnings.ts` **[MEASURED]** |
| AI companion | **Fully implemented, flag-gated off** for *"the premium packaging milestone"* | `featureFlags.ts`, `TripWorkspace.tsx:289` **[MEASURED]** |
| M7 schema contract | `sale_events`, `payouts`, entitlements table, KYC fields, Razorpay ids, webhook log with idempotency keys | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §"Creator earnings contract (M7)" **[MEASURED]** |
| Payment rail | **Does not exist** | **[MEASURED]** |
| Entitlements | **Does not exist** | **[MEASURED]** |
| Analytics backend | **Does not exist**; `computeFunnel()` runs server-side in the admin console | **[MEASURED]** |

**The paywall is designed.** The blurred-teaser-then-unlock pattern, the free-day index, the
dual CTA, and the explicit degradation path for forkers are all shipped. What is missing is the
rail underneath them.

One detail worth calling out as genuinely good design: **forking a paid itinerary copies only the
free days.** The paid content is not handed over at fork time — it arrives as placeholders the
forker fills in themselves. That is a deliberate anti-leak decision, and it is already in the
code.

---

## 2. The two products, and why their economics differ completely

This distinction drives the entire plan and is easy to get wrong.

| | **A — Premium itinerary unlock** | **B — AI companion** |
|---|---|---|
| What the buyer gets | Locked days: stay contacts, timings, budget breakdown | Grounded answers about their own trip |
| Marginal cost today | **₹0** | **₹0** (deterministic) |
| Marginal cost once upgraded | **₹0** | **Real** — per-query tokens |
| Recurrence | One-off per itinerary | Subscription |
| Ceiling | Audience × content supply | Audience |
| Refund risk | High (digital content, seen-then-refunded) | Low |
| Cannibalisation | Moderate — a free good itinerary substitutes | Low |
| Supply dependency | **Creator-dependent** | None |
| Build cost | Rail + entitlements | Rail + entitlements (same rail) |

**The consequence is a design rule, not an opinion:**

- **Unlocks are near-100% gross margin but supply- and audience-capped.** They cannot carry a
  business alone (section 7 proves this arithmetically) but they cost nothing to offer.
- **A subscription is uncapped and recurring, but carries variable cost** — and today's
  deterministic companion may not be worth paying for at all, because a rule-based analysis of
  your own trip data is something users may read as "the app told me what it already shows me".

**So the honest sequencing is:** ship the unlock first, because it needs no new product — the
surface is built. Ship the companion as a paid tier **only after it becomes an LLM**, because
that is the version with a defensible reason to pay, and only with a measured token budget.

---

## 3. Pricing design

### 3.1 The price points that already exist

₹149 / ₹199 / ₹249 / ₹499 **[MEASURED]**. They are not arbitrary — they track itinerary length
and depth. ₹199 is the modal value and the working assumption throughout this document.

### 3.2 Pricing the unlock

**What the buyer actually receives** (from the shipped locked-day copy): stay contacts, timings,
and a budget breakdown for the locked days. That is the deliverable, and it is specific — which
is good, because vague value cannot hold a price.

**Anchors for a ₹199 price point** — all **[ASSUMPTION]**, listed so they can be challenged:

| Comparable | Typical price | Why it anchors |
|---|---|---|
| A regional road-trip guidebook | ₹300–600 | The direct substitute for a good itinerary |
| A travel agent's consultation | ₹500–2,000 | What people pay for human route planning |
| A one-off paid newsletter / Notion template | ₹99–499 | The creator-economy convention |
| A single restaurant meal on the trip | ₹300–600 | The in-trip reference point |

**Recommendation: hold ₹199 for a full multi-day itinerary, and use the existing tiering.**
Rationale: it sits below the guidebook and well below an agent consult, it is the already-chosen
modal price, and it is an impulse-scale amount that does not require deliberation. Do **not**
raise it before measuring copy→pay — a price rise on an unmeasured funnel is unfalsifiable.

### 3.3 Pricing the AI companion

**The problem with the current version.** It is deterministic and grounded. Its answers cite
assumptions and are derived from trip data the user already entered. That is *honest* — and it
is hard to charge for, because the user cannot easily see what they are buying that they did not
already have. Selling it as-is risks refund requests and reputational cost.

**What makes it sellable is the upgrade path already documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`:** an LLM
with engine grounding. Natural-language questions, arbitrary scope, reasoning over the whole
trip. That is a different product and it has a real reason to exist.

**Packaging options:**

| Option | Price | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly subscription | ₹99–149 | Recurring; matches consumer habit | Needs continuous value; token COGS |
| Per-trip unlock | ₹49–99 | Matches how people plan (episodically) | Low LTV per user |
| Bundled with unlocks | Free above ₹X spend | Drives unlock conversion | Gives away the recurring SKU |

**Recommendation: subscription at ₹99/month, with a per-trip option at ₹49 tested in parallel.**
The reason to lead with ₹99 rather than ₹149: the trip-planning use case is episodic, so a
subscription is already fighting user behaviour. A lower price reduces the "why am I paying in a
month I'm not travelling" objection, and the token COGS at ₹99 is comfortable if the cost is
managed (see below). Test both; do not assume.

**The token budget rule.** Once the companion is an LLM, price must satisfy:

```
monthly price  ≥  10 × (expected monthly token cost of the MEDIAN subscriber)
```

The 10× multiple absorbs heavy users and the long tail without a per-query cap. Token cost per
query is **[UNKNOWN]** and must be measured in Stage 1 before the companion is priced. Do not
launch a paid LLM tier without that number — it is the only variable cost in the business.

### 3.4 What not to price yet

The marketplace take rate (Stage 4) and B2B licences (Stage 5). Pricing a partner commission
before there is a single partner is guesswork dressed as planning.

---

## 4. The fee model — the actual arithmetic

This is the part every previous version of the report skipped, and it is where a marketplace
quietly loses money.

### 4.1 The floor: costs incurred before the platform earns anything

| Cost | Rate | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Razorpay TDR | 2.00% | Domestic transactions, zero setup fee **[MEASURED — Razorpay public pricing]** |
| GST on the TDR | 0.36% | 18% of the 2% TDR **[MEASURED]** |
| **Effective payment cost** | **2.36%** | On a ₹100 transaction: ₹2 TDR + ₹0.36 GST **[MEASURED]** |
| TDS u/s 194-O | ~1.00% | On gross payments to sellers by an e-commerce operator **[MEASURED — needs CA confirmation; rates are amended by Finance Acts]** |
| GST TCS u/s 52 | ~0.50% | Separate from 194-O **[MEASURED — needs CA confirmation]** |
| **Total floor** | **≈3.86%** | **[DERIVED]** |

**A platform fee below ~4% is net-negative.** That is the floor, and it is why "just take 2%"
is not an option.

### 4.2 The structural decision: who is the supplier?

This decides GST incidence, and the arithmetic is not cosmetic.

**Branch 1 — the creator is the supplier, YatraFlow is an intermediary.** YatraFlow's taxable
supply is its own fee; the creator is responsible for GST on the content.

**Branch 2 — YatraFlow is merchant of record.** YatraFlow's taxable supply is the full ₹199.

| | Branch 1 (intermediary) | Branch 2 (merchant of record) |
|---|---|---|
| GST base | YatraFlow's fee only | The full ₹199 |
| GST at 18% on ₹199 | — | **₹30.36** |
| Creator receives (at a 15% fee) | **₹161.47** | **₹134.10** |
| Creator take as % of gross | **81.1%** | **67.4%** |

**[DERIVED]** — GST computed as `199 × 18/118 = ₹30.36` (prices in India are displayed
GST-inclusive).

**Branch 2 costs the creator about ₹27 per sale** — more than the platform fee itself earns at
15%. Choosing merchant-of-record without noticing this would make the creator programme
uneconomic for exactly the creators it needs.

**Recommendation: structure as Branch 1.** YatraFlow is a platform, not a publisher; the fee is
its supply. **This is a legal and tax structuring decision and must be confirmed with a
chartered accountant before the first sale.** I am not a tax adviser and the rates above are
amended by Finance Acts.

### 4.3 Recommended fee structure

| Benchmark | Rate |
|---|---|
| Topmate (India) | **10% platform fee + ~2.9% processing ≈ 12.9% total** **[MEASURED]** |
| Gumroad | Gumroad-shaped ledger anatomy, per `ARCHITECTURE.md` **[MEASURED]** |

**Recommendation: 15% flat platform fee, tiered down to 10% above a lifetime-GMV threshold.**

- 15% clears the ~3.86% floor with real margin, and sits close to the ~12.9% Indian market norm
  so it will not repel creators.
- The tiered discount is the retention mechanic: it rewards creators who stay, and it costs
  nothing until they are already earning.
- Set the tier threshold once real GMV exists — not now.

**Why not higher:** creator supply is the binding constraint on Product A. At 25% the platform
would clear more per sale and attract far fewer creators, which is the wrong trade when the
scarcest resource is content.

### 4.4 Worked example: one ₹199 unlock, rupee by rupee

Branch 1, 15% fee, prices GST-inclusive **[DERIVED]**:

| Line | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Buyer pays | **₹199.00** | |
| Razorpay TDR (2%) | −₹3.98 | |
| GST on TDR (18%) | −₹0.72 | |
| **Available** | **₹194.30** | |
| Platform fee (15% of ₹199) | ₹29.85 | |
| Creator gross | ₹164.45 | |
| Less 194-O TDS (1%) | −₹1.99 | Withheld, deposited against the creator's PAN |
| Less GST TCS (0.5%) | −₹1.00 | |
| **Creator net payout** | **₹161.47** | 81.1% of gross |
| Platform fee | ₹29.85 | |
| Less GST on the fee (18/118) | −₹4.55 | |
| **Platform net revenue** | **₹25.30** | **12.7% of gross** |

**So the real number to model is ₹25.30 per ₹199 unlock — not ₹199 and not ₹29.85.** Every
revenue figure in section 7 uses ₹25.30.

---

## 5. The stage-wise plan

Five stages. Each has an entry gate, a build, revenue mechanics, unit economics, an exit gate,
kill criteria, **and failure modes** — because the failure modes are what the previous report
never listed.

---

### Stage 0 — Instrument · now · ₹0 revenue

**Purpose.** You cannot price what you cannot measure, and three of the four numbers that
determine revenue are measurable today for free.

**Steps**

1. **Clean the public gallery.** One itinerary exists and it is a duplicate named `(copy)` with a
   mangled author name **[MEASURED]**. Unpublish the duplicates — `dedupePublished()` and the
   unpublish owner gate ship already.
2. **Record the funnel weekly.** `computeFunnel()` already returns `activationPct`, `collabPct`,
   `publishPct`, `viewToCopyPct`, plus raw `views` and `copies` **[MEASURED]**. Put it in the
   admin console and write it down. No new instrumentation required.
3. **Set the fee model constant.** `PROJECTED_PLATFORM_FEE_INR` is the seam **[MEASURED]**.
4. **Decide the merchant-of-record question with a CA** (§4.2). It changes the creator payout by
   ~₹27 per sale and cannot be deferred past the first sale.
5. **Record infrastructure invoices.** Currently **[UNKNOWN]** — the actual Supabase/Vercel bills
   are not in the repo and the free-tier assumption is unverified.

**Exit gate:** four consecutive weeks of funnel data, a curated gallery, a CA-confirmed tax
structure.
**Kill criterion:** none. This stage is always worth doing.
**Failure mode:** measuring for four weeks and changing nothing. The point is to have a baseline
before spending a rupee on distribution.

---

### Stage 1 — Prove demand · M5 · ₹0 revenue

**Purpose.** Prove people return, and that the engine produces trips worth paying for — before
building a payment rail.

**Steps**

1. **Ship the AI companion to the free tier.** It is built and flag-gated **[MEASURED]**. Release
   it free and measure whether it moves retention. A paywall on a feature nobody misses earns
   nothing.
2. **Instrument the companion's usage** — queries per user per month. This is the input to the
   token budget in §3.3, and it must exist before the LLM upgrade is priced.
3. **Write the Stage 2 thresholds down now.** Deciding the pass mark after seeing the result is
   how a metric becomes a story.
4. **Publish 20 reference itineraries** through the shipped creator flow. This is Stage 2's
   inventory, and it costs only the founder's time.
5. **Qualitative pricing research** with the existing cohort, reachable via the invite system.
   Directional only.

**Exit gate:** view→copy above the pre-set mark; creator supply ≥ the pre-set count; week-4
retention ≥ the pre-set rate.
**Kill criterion:** if retention is flat and view→copy is near zero, **do not build M7**. The
problem is the product, and the correct move is back to M6.
**Failure mode:** shipping the companion free, seeing usage rise, and concluding the *paid*
version will sell. Free usage proves interest, not willingness to pay.

---

### Stage 2 — The first rupee · M7 · unlocks

**Purpose.** Convert proven demand into revenue with the smallest build available, because the
surface already exists.

**Steps — the build, from the shipped M7 contract [MEASURED]**

1. **Migration** (schema in §6): `sale_events`, `payouts`, `entitlements`, KYC fields on
   `profiles`.
2. **Razorpay**: order creation, webhooks with **idempotency keys**, refund path, dispute handling.
3. **Redacting read path + narrowed RLS — this is the first thing to build, not the third.**
   An audit of the publish path on 2026-09-15 proved against production that the
   lock is a CSS overlay: `publishItinerary` sets `trips.visibility = 'public'`, the `trips read`
   RLS policy has no `to` clause so it applies to `anon`, and the entire itinerary lives in that
   row's `days` column. **Both live premium publications (₹199 and ₹500) returned all 7 locked
   days and 20 stops to an unauthenticated client.** Add a redacting `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC
   mirroring `get_invite_trip`, and narrow the table policy — together, or the public page breaks.
4. **Set the fee model** — replace `PROJECTED_PLATFORM_FEE_INR = 0`.
5. **Switch on the existing unlock buttons** (two per page, already placed).
6. **GST/TDS registration and invoicing** — see §4.2.

**Revenue mechanics.** Revenue = `views × view→copy × copy→pay × ₹199 × 15%`, netting ₹25.30 per
unlock **[DERIVED]**.

**Exit gate:** at least one creator has received a **real payout**, and there is evidence of
repeat purchase.
**Kill criterion:** fewer than a pre-set number of paid unlocks in 60 days at the seeded prices →
the content marketplace is not the wedge. Revert to subscription-only and stop investing in the
unlock flow.
**Failure modes:**

- **Piracy by re-publication.** Forking copies only free days, so the fork itself does not leak.
  But `publishItinerary` performs **no provenance check** — fork a *free* publication, and you own
  a complete copy you can re-publish as your own. This has already occurred: the live gallery
  contains a duplicate. **Resolved by the publish-path audit**, which also
  found the larger problem that the locked content is readable without forking at all. Record
  provenance at publish time, and block or strip derived content.
- **The lock is not an access control.** See step 3. Until the redacting read path ships, the
  unlock is a UI convention and **no sale should be taken**.
- **Refund abuse.** Digital content seen-then-refunded. Mitigate with a clear pre-purchase
  description of exactly what unlocks, and a no-refund-after-view policy stated at checkout.
- **Creator supply collapse.** Unlocks need creators. If the first creators earn near nothing,
  the programme dies before it starts. Consider seeding the first 20 itineraries as
  platform-authored so the shelf is not empty on day one.
- **Cannibalisation.** A good free itinerary removes the reason to buy a different one. The free
  day count (`freeDayIndexes`) is the lever — it must be generous enough to prove quality and
  stingy enough to leave a reason to pay.

---

### Stage 3 — Subscription becomes the primary SKU · M8/M9

**Purpose.** Product A is audience-capped (section 7). The subscription is not.

**Steps**

1. **Upgrade the companion to an LLM with engine grounding** — the documented path
   **[MEASURED]**. This is the version worth paying for.
2. **Measure token cost per query** before setting a price. Enforce the 10× rule (§3.3).
3. **Price at ₹99/month**, with a ₹49 per-trip option tested in parallel.
4. **Bundle decision:** do subscribers get unlocks included? Recommend a monthly unlock
   allowance rather than unlimited — unlimited converts a near-zero-marginal-cost product into a
   creator-payout liability.
5. **Invite gate (M9 R3)** — only if quality needs protecting. The repo's own plan says it *"may
   be deferred indefinitely — that is a valid end state"* **[MEASURED]**.

**Exit gate:** a **measured** CAC, and a repeatable monthly subscriber count.
**Kill criterion:** if median subscriber token cost exceeds 20% of price, the packaging is wrong.
Fix the packaging before spending on acquisition.
**Failure mode:** **episodic use versus recurring billing.** Trip planning is a few times a year.
Expect high month-2 churn, and design for it — a per-trip option, or a pause rather than a
cancel. Do not model subscription revenue as flat monthly retention until it is measured.

---

### Stage 4 — Marketplace · post-1.0 · commissions

**Purpose.** The marketplace every previous version led with. It belongs here because it is a
**supply-operations business**, not a feature.

**Steps**

1. **Manual pilot** — 5–10 drivers or homestays, onboarded by hand, no code.
2. Measure whether manual onboarding produces **repeat bookings**.
3. Only then build verification, onboarding, payouts, disputes, insurance.

**The mistake not to repeat.** The previous report budgeted ₹1,500 CAC per driver and **no
headcount** for a stage requiring field operations and payouts. Marketplace revenue is earned by
people talking to drivers, and that cost appeared nowhere.
**Kill criterion:** if the hand-onboarded pilot does not produce repeat bookings, the marketplace
thesis is wrong. Run that experiment before building anything.

---

### Stage 5 — B2B licences · post-1.0

White-label itinerary building for travel agents. Needs a stable 1.0, an API, and support
capacity. Listed for completeness; not a twelve-month plan.

---

## 6. The data model M7 needs

From the shipped contract in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` **[MEASURED]**, expanded with the reasoning
each column needs — plus one item the audit added, which comes first.

### 6.0 The redacting read path — build this before the rest

**Added by the publish-path audit of 2026-09-15.** The schema below is worthless without it,
because entitlements gate a read and the read is currently ungated.

> The full audit write-up — including the reproduction detail — is **held outside this repository
> until the fix ships**, so this document carries the finding, the evidence and the fix without
> the how-to.

Proven against production: `publishItinerary` sets `trips.visibility = 'public'`; the
`trips read` policy (`schema.sql:342`) has **no `to` clause**, so it applies to `anon`; and the
entire itinerary is the `days` column on that row. Both live premium publications returned all
locked days to an unauthenticated client.

```
1. get_public_trip(p_trip_id uuid)   SECURITY DEFINER
   - reads the publication's free_day_indexes
   - returns locked days as stubs, UNLESS an entitlement exists for auth.uid()
   - grant execute to anon, authenticated
2. drop policy "trips read" on public.trips;
   create policy "trips read" on public.trips
     for select to authenticated using (
       auth.uid() = owner_id or public.is_member(trips.id)
     );
3. point fetchSharedTrip() at the RPC instead of `select *`
```

Two traps: a `SECURITY DEFINER` function returning the raw row would be **worse** than today
(it bypasses RLS); and the entitlement check must live **inside the function**, not in the client.

### `sale_events`

| Column | Why |
|---|---|
| `id` | Primary key |
| `pub_id` | Which itinerary was unlocked |
| `buyer_id` / guest ref | Nullable — anonymous buyers must be supported, since anonymous viewing and saving already work **[MEASURED]** |
| `amount_inr` | What was actually charged |
| `price_snapshot_inr` | **The price at the time of sale.** Prices will change; a payout must not be recomputed from today's price |
| `status` | `created` / `paid` / `refunded` — refunds must be first-class, not deletions |
| `created_at` | For payout periods and the ledger |

Plus Razorpay `order_id` and `payment_id`, and a **webhook log with idempotency keys** — Razorpay
retries webhooks, and a double-credited sale is a real payout error.

### `entitlements`

The table that makes the lock real. Minimum: `user_id`, `pub_id`, `granted_at`, `source`
(purchase / grant / bundle). Without it, premium gating is client-side only and the paid content
is one API call away — which is the difference between a paywall and a decoration.

### `payouts`

`creator_id`, `period_start`, `period_end`, `gross_inr`, `fees_inr`, `tds_inr`, `tcs_inr`,
`net_inr`, `status`, **`utr_reference`** (the bank reference — the only proof a creator has that
money moved).

### `profiles` additions

Payout-account and KYC fields. **This is a hard dependency on creator onboarding** and it is the
step most likely to be underestimated: a creator cannot be paid without verified bank details,
and the collection of those details is a product surface that does not exist.

### The refund path

Every refund reverses a `sale_event`, revokes the entitlement, and creates a **negative line in
the creator's next payout**. If this is not designed up front, the first refund silently pays the
creator for a sale that was reversed.

## 7. Financial model — the range the unknowns span

### 7.1 The parameters

| # | Parameter | Value | Tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Unlock price | ₹199 | **[MEASURED]** (seed) |
| 2 | Platform fee | 15% | **[DECISION]** |
| 3 | **Net platform revenue per unlock** | **₹25.30** | **[DERIVED]** §4.4 |
| 4 | Monthly itinerary views | — | **[UNKNOWN]** |
| 5 | view→copy | — | **[UNKNOWN — measurable in Stage 0]** |
| 6 | copy→pay | — | **[UNKNOWN]** |
| 7 | Subscription price | ₹99/month | **[DECISION]** |
| 8 | Token cost per query | — | **[UNKNOWN — measurable in Stage 1]** |
| 9 | Infrastructure cost | free tiers assumed, invoices unread | **[UNKNOWN]** |

### 7.2 Unlocks: the binding constraint is audience, not conversion

Monthly platform revenue from unlocks at ₹25.30 each:

| view→copy ↓ / copy→pay → | 3% | 6% | 10% |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2%** | ₹76 | ₹152 | ₹253 |
| **4%** | ₹152 | ₹304 | ₹506 |
| **6%** | ₹228 | ₹455 | ₹759 |

**[DERIVED]** — at 5,000 monthly views. Multiply by 10 for 50,000 views, by 50 for 250,000.

Now invert it. **What does it take to reach ₹5,00,000/month from unlocks alone?**

```
₹5,00,000 ÷ ₹25.30 = 19,763 unlocks/month
At 4% view→copy and 6% copy→pay  →  ~8,234,000 views/month
At 6% view→copy and 10% copy→pay →  ~3,294,000 views/month
```

**[DERIVED]** — **you need 3.3–8.2 million itinerary views per month.** For scale, the current
gallery has **3 views total** **[MEASURED]**.

**This is the finding that should govern the plan.** Optimising view→copy from 4% to 6% moves
₹304 to ₹455. The constraint is not conversion — it is that nobody is looking. Unlocks are a
supplement, permanently.

### 7.3 Subscriptions: the same money, a plausible path

| Price | Subscribers for ₹5,00,000/month | Gross margin after a ₹10/month token cost |
|---|---|---|
| ₹99 | **5,051** | 89.9% |
| ₹149 | **3,356** | 93.3% |

**[DERIVED]**

**~5,000 subscribers is a reachable number for a niche Indian travel tool. 3.3 million monthly
views is not.** That comparison is the entire argument for subscription-first.

### 7.4 Three scenarios

All **[ASSUMPTION]** except the per-unit economics, which are **[DERIVED]**.

| | Bear | Base | Bull |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly views | 5,000 | 50,000 | 250,000 |
| view→copy | 2% | 4% | 6% |
| copy→pay | 3% | 6% | 10% |
| Unlocks/month | 3 | 120 | 1,500 |
| Unlock revenue | ₹76 | ₹3,036 | ₹37,950 |
| Subscribers | 0 | 250 | 2,000 |
| Subscription revenue | ₹0 | ₹24,750 | ₹1,98,000 |
| **Total / month** | **₹76** | **₹27,786** | **₹2,35,950** |
| **Total / year** | **₹912** | **₹3.33 L** | **₹28.3 L** |

**A 3,000× spread between the bear and bull cases.** That is not a forecast — it is an honest
statement that the model is dominated by unknowns. **Which is the argument for Stage 0: three of
those unknowns can be measured this week, for free.**

For comparison, the previous report claimed **₹2.05 Crores in Year 1** — roughly **7× the bull
case here**, with no measurement behind it.

### 7.5 Break-even

The business is not capital-intensive until Stage 4. Fixed cost today is the founder's time plus
infrastructure **[UNKNOWN]**. If infrastructure is ₹10,000/month, break-even is:

```
₹10,000 ÷ ₹25.30 = 395 unlocks/month     (unlocks alone)
₹10,000 ÷ ₹99    = 101 subscribers/month (subscriptions alone)
```

**[DERIVED]** — **101 subscribers covers infrastructure.** That is the first real milestone, and
it is far more motivating than a TAM.

## 8. Conversion mechanics — what actually moves each number

### 8.1 view→copy

The fork button competes with a free alternative: close the tab. Levers, in order:

1. **The preview image.** With no OG tags and hash routing **[MEASURED]**, a shared link is a bare
   URL. Fixing this is the highest-leverage conversion work available and it is not a product
   change at all.
2. **Free-day generosity.** `freeDayIndexes` decides how much is proven before the ask. One free
   day of a 10-day trip proves nothing.
3. **The route summary and ₹/person.** Already on the page. The cost number is the hook.

### 8.2 copy→pay

1. **Specificity of the locked promise.** *"Stay contacts, timings and budget breakdown"* is
   already specific **[MEASURED]**. Do not weaken it into "full access".
2. **The blurred teaser.** Showing the first 3 stops blurred is the right instinct; the number of
   teaser stops is a testable variable.
3. **Trust at the moment of payment.** The app's whole positioning is honesty. The checkout must
   carry the same voice: what you get, what you do not, and when a refund is possible.
4. **Price.** Test ₹149 against ₹199 **only after** a baseline exists.

### 8.3 Experiments worth running, in order

| # | Test | Metric |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | OG preview on / off | view→copy |
| 2 | 1 vs 2 free days | copy→pay |
| 3 | 3 vs 5 teaser stops | copy→pay |
| 4 | ₹149 vs ₹199 | revenue per view |
| 5 | Subscription vs per-trip | month-2 retention |

## 9. Risks

| # | Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Locked content is publicly readable** — proven live: 7 locked days / 20 stops returned to an unauthenticated client | **Critical** | Redacting RPC + narrowed RLS, before the first sale |
| 2 | **Audience is zero** — the model's dominant variable | **High** | Stage 0 measurement, then distribution before monetisation |
| 3 | **Merchant-of-record chosen by accident** | **High** | CA decision in Stage 0; costs ~₹27/sale |
| 4 | **Creator supply never starts** | High | Seed the first 20 itineraries as platform-authored |
| 5 | **Subscription churn** — episodic use vs monthly billing | Medium | Per-trip option; pause instead of cancel |
| 6 | **Refund abuse** | Medium | Pre-purchase description + stated policy |
| 7 | **Token cost blowout** once the companion is an LLM | Medium | The 10× rule; measure before pricing |
| 8 | **GST/TDS misregistration** | Medium | CA before the first sale |
| 9 | **Payout KYC is a product surface nobody built** | Medium | Scope it in Stage 2, not after the first sale |
| 10 | **Refund handling absent from the payout model** | Medium | Negative lines in the next payout |

## 10. What would prove this plan wrong

Stated in advance, so it cannot be rationalised later.

| If this is true | Then |
|---|---|
| view→copy stays under 2% after the preview fix | The itinerary is not the shareable unit. Change the artifact. |
| copy→pay under 2% at ₹199 | Content is not worth paying for at this price. Test ₹49 or drop Product A. |
| Median subscriber token cost > 20% of price | The subscription packaging is wrong. Fix it before acquiring. |
| Month-2 subscriber retention under 40% | The use case is too episodic for a subscription. Go per-trip. |
| Manual partner pilot produces no repeat bookings | The marketplace thesis is wrong. Stage 4 is cancelled, not delayed. |

---

## 11. Decisions required now

| # | Decision | Why it blocks | Needed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Merchant of record: Branch 1 or 2 (§4.2) | Changes creator payout ~₹27/sale | Stage 0, with a CA |
| 2 | Platform fee: confirm 15% | Sets `PROJECTED_PLATFORM_FEE_INR` | Stage 0 |
| 3 | Subscription price: ₹99 vs ₹149 | Sets the primary SKU | Stage 3 |
| 4 | Free-day policy default | Drives copy→pay | Stage 2 |
| 5 | Re-publication policy for unlocked content | The leak | **Before Stage 2 launch** |
| 5b | Redacting read path + narrowed RLS | Without it the unlock sells nothing | **Before the first sale — blocks Stage 2** |
| 6 | Refund policy wording | Legal + abuse | Before the first sale |
| 7 | Do subscribers get unlock allowances? | Liability design | Stage 3 |

---

## 12. The one-page summary

1. **The paywall is already built** — prices chosen, free-day index, blurred teaser, two CTAs,
   fork degradation, ledger, fee seam. Only the rail is missing. Stage 2 is cheap.
2. **Net platform revenue per ₹199 unlock is ₹25.30, not ₹199.** The floor is ~3.86% before the
   platform earns anything.
3. **Structure as an intermediary, not merchant of record** — the difference is ~₹27 per sale to
   the creator, more than the platform fee itself. Confirm with a CA.
4. **Unlocks cannot carry the business.** ₹5 Lakhs/month needs 3.3–8.2 million views. The gallery
   currently has 3.
5. **Subscriptions can.** ₹5 Lakhs/month needs ~5,000 subscribers; infrastructure break-even
   needs **101**.
6. **The companion is deterministic today and worth little as a paid tier.** Its value arrives
   with the documented LLM upgrade — and so does its cost. Apply the 10× rule.
7. **The dominant unknown is audience, and it is measurable this week for free.**
8. **The lock does not exist yet.** An audit against production proved the locked days are
   readable by an unauthenticated client — 7 locked days and 20 stops across both live premium
   publications. The redacting read path is now **item zero of M7**, and no sale should be taken
   before it ships.
