/**
 * Owner-facing control to set / change / clear a trip's cover image.
 *   • The preview shows what the trip's cards will show: the chosen image, or
 *     the generated artwork for its own places, or the emoji when neither can
 *     load. Nothing here fetches a photo on its own.
 *   • "Use destination photo" is an explicit action: it looks up a popular
 *     Wikipedia image of the trip's headline destination and stores it as
 *     coverImageUrl, sized through `Special:Redirect` so no row ever holds a
 *     multi-megabyte original.
 *   • A custom URL lets the owner override with any image.
 *   • "Use artwork" clears the image so the cards fall back to the generated
 *     artwork. It clears the URL ONLY: the stored upload object stays, because
 *     a fork or a publication may still reference it.
 *   • "Upload image" shrinks a picked photo to 1200px, re-encodes it as JPEG
 *     and stores it in our own public bucket (lib/coverUpload.ts), so the
 *     creator is not limited to photos someone else hosts. Replacing one adds
 *     a new object and leaves the old in place — see uploadCover for why.
 * The choice is carried over on fork / publish via store.ts.
