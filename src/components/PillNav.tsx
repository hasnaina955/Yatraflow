// ============ PillNav — pill navs with a sliding active indicator ============
// One mechanic for every pill nav (top nav, workspace tab bar): an absolutely
// positioned "glider" pill slides behind the active item instead of each item
// painting its own background, so switching reads as one continuous motion.
// The glider is measured from the active item, re-measured when the row
// reflows or the webfont swaps in, and skips its transition on first paint so
// pages don't animate on load.
//
// The glide is a FLIP — the same technique the drag settle uses: the target
// box's width/height are WRITTEN to the element and never transitioned, while
// the visible motion is a transform from the previous box (translate to the old
// origin, scaled by oldWidth/newWidth, settling at scaleX(1)). Transitioning
// left/width/top/height instead relaid out the nav on every tab change, which
// is what docs/MOTION-TOKENS.md's "thumb `transform` slide" row described all
// along — the code now matches the catalog.
