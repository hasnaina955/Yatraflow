// ============ Recorded-traffic trend ============
//
// The one chart on the creator hub, and deliberately only one: visits (area),
// forks (line) and unlocks (marks) over the selected window, drawn from the
// SAME series the table below reads (`buildDailySeries`), so the panel and the
// rows cannot describe different periods.
//
// Choices worth naming:
//   * ONE shared scale for all three steps. A second axis would make unlocks
//     look healthy next to a visits collapse, which is the opposite of what a
//     conversion chart is for. Unlocks are sparse by nature and honestly read
//     as marks near the floor.
//   * EMPTY DAYS STAY. The series carries them (see `buildDailySeries`), so a
//     quiet week draws a quiet line instead of being compressed into a slope
//     that never happened.
//   * MONOTONE CUBIC smoothing, not Catmull-Rom: a smoothed line must never
//     overshoot between two points, because on a chart of counts an overshoot
//     draws traffic that never happened and an area that dips below zero.
//     Fritsch–Carlson tangents keep the curve inside the data.
//   * No gridline furniture: the peak and the zero are the only numbers the
//     line needs, and both are stated in the panel head, the axis row and the
//     hover guide. The window's date span is labelled underneath.
//   * Colour comes from CSS classes, never hex here, so the panel follows the
//     theme like every other surface.
