// ============ The unlock moment (ROADMAP I-20) ============
// Paying for a plan used to end in a toast: the days quietly became readable
// and nothing acknowledged what had just been bought. This is the ceremony the
// research asks for — "You now own X", listing what is INSIDE, and every line
// of it computed from the itinerary the buyer just gained. No adjectives.
//
// The order matters as much as the content (research §4): the reveal lands
// first, and the fork CTA sits inside it, because the moment a plan appears in
// your own workspace is when a purchase feels worth its price. Dismissing it
// costs nothing — the plan is already theirs, and the shelf remembers it.
//
// Motion follows the token catalog: a full-screen sheet is a large surface
// (--motion-slow + --ease-out), the facts take the entrance pattern, and both
// opt out under prefers-reduced-motion (AGENTS rule 10).
