// ============ M6 B3 · shared remote-edit conflict hook ============
// Extracted from TimelineTab so the Board's stop editor (BoardView) surfaces
// the same amber keep-mine/take-theirs banner the Timeline's does — the two
// views open the SAME StopEditor modal, and a crew member editing from either
// surface must not silently edit stale data.
//
// Detection is pure (lib/realtimeCore.ts stopWasRemotelyEdited): snapshot the
// stop the moment the editor opens; while the editor is open the draft writes
// through only on save, so ANY drift between the snapshot and the live trip is
// a remote (or another-surface) edit. The comparison is canonical (jsonb
// reorders object keys on the wire; a naive stringify compare would
// phantom-flag every hydration).
