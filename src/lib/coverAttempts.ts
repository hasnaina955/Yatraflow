// ============ Cover candidates — the finite image chain ============
// A cover plan names the images that honestly fit, in the plan's own order. This
// module turns that plan into the exact URLs a renderer may try, and nothing
// else. Pure: no React, no network, no clock.
//
// Three rules, and each one exists because its absence shipped a bug:
//   1. A scene with no bundled file is SKIPPED, never tried. The build's glob is
//      the only source of truth for what exists, so a manifest entry whose files
//      were never generated costs the chain nothing.
//   2. A scene is tried in AVIF first and in WebP second, as two separate
//      candidates. A browser that cannot decode AVIF, or a network that refuses
//      the file, then costs one step inside the scene instead of the scene's
//      whole slot. RegionArt could not do this: it rejected an id with no AVIF
//      file outright, so a WebP-only scene never painted.
//   3. Every candidate carries a distinct URL. The chain is finite, its order is
//      a pure function of the plan, and a renderer that walks it once cannot
//      loop.
