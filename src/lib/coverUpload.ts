// ============ coverUpload — creator-uploaded cover images ============
// A cover is what a shared link previews with (api/i.js serves the stored URL
// as og:image), so this path deliberately produces something the preview can
// use as-is: an https URL on our own public bucket, ~150-250 KB, no larger than
// the width the app already asks Wikimedia for. That last part is the whole
// cost story — storage and egress are both proportional to bytes, and a
// creator's phone original is 20-50x the bytes for no visible gain at the
// sizes we render (a trip card, a 1200px link card).
//
// The rules live here, apart from the DOM work, because the node test suite has
// no canvas: `coverFileError` / `fitCoverSize` / `coverObjectPath` /
// `coverRandomName` / `isSuggestedCover` are pure and pinned by tests, and only
// `downscaleCover` / `uploadCover` / `ownSuggestedCover` touch the browser and
// the network.
