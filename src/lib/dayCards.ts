// ============ The Timeline's per-day card facts (#347) ============
// Every day card is a memoized component, and that memo could never bite: `trip`
// is a fresh object on every store commit (`mutateTrip` clones) and its identity
// was a prop, so one stop edit re-rendered EVERY day — and each day re-derived
// its own journey, schedule and anchors from the whole trip while it was at it.
//
// So the trip-wide slice a day card actually reads is resolved ONCE per trip
// change here, and a day is handed back the SAME object while none of its inputs
// changed (the React.memo on DaySection then bails out, and the engine math is
// not re-run either). `dayCardKey` is the input list — the same reads
// `buildJourney`/`simulateDay`/`originOf`/`nextAfter`/`predecessorOf` make — and
// tests pin it in both directions: changing any of those inputs busts the day,
// and changing something else does not. When you teach a day card to read a new
// trip field, it goes in `dayCardKey` in the same commit, or the card renders
// one edit behind.
