// ============ The day's slots (the slots-rail engine, plan P1) ============
// A slot view over the halt segmentation: what the day is MISSING (lunch,
// fuel, dinner, stay), filled by search, comparison, or vote. Slots are
// DERIVED, never stored - they are a pure projection of engine output, so
// they can never drift from the engine.
//
// Three slot states (the mockup's grammar):
//   filled - one quiet line; the stop that fills it
//   empty  - candidates inside; tap to compare, source, or vote
//   auto   - engine-managed (stretch halts); a dim line, no work demanded
//
// Data rules this module keeps:
//   - Slots derive from `SegmentHit`s (planRideSegments via planJourneyHalts),
//     the day's itinerary stops, and the already-computed candidate pool.
//   - Every number shown (detour minutes, budget share, arrival) is already
//     computed by the engine - nothing is re-estimated here.
//   - Windows are the engine's own constants (LUNCH_WINDOW, DINNER_WINDOW,
//     BREAKFAST_WINDOW) - never re-declared.
//   - Day slicing walks the journey-ordered segments' `dayEnd` flags: each
//     overnight segment closes its day, so no geometry or day-index plumbing
//     is needed and a segment can never land in the wrong day.
//   - A generic stop only fills a meal/stay slot through its own category,
//     its reported opening hours overlapping the slot's window, or the
//     nearest-window fallback - two slots never claim one stop.
