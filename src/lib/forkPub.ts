 *  the same reason the RPC does: the page's own locked copy promises the
 *  BUDGET BREAKDOWN is in the full plan, so a viewer who has not bought it
 *  must not receive it through a fork either. The flag is passed in from the
 *  publication's price rather than derived here, because the rule is "priced
 *  and not entitled" and not "has locked days": a trip-level expense carries
 *  no `dayIndex` for a filter to key on, and a row whose days came back empty

/** Fork `pub` into the viewer's trips. Login-gated. The days forked are

 *  reads through get_public_trip, which already returned real days for the
 *  creator / an entitled buyer and wire-stubbed locked days for everyone
 *  else. Returns false when the underlying trip vanished, the viewer must log
 *  in first (navigation already handled), or the rows failed to persist — in
 *  which case no half-saved fork is left behind to vanish on the next reload.
 *
 *  #349 — the entitlement is asked for, never assumed from a cache hit. Two
 *  things used to strand a paying buyer on placeholders: `tripById(pub.tripId)`
 *  was preferred over the RPC, so a pre-purchase stub in the cache won the read,
 *  and the re-stub below ran unconditionally, so even a correctly-served real
 *  trip was re-locked on the way into the copy. Now the wire is read first (a
 *  cache hit is not evidence of anything about entitlement), and the re-stub is
 *  skipped only when the server confirms the entitlement AND the row it served
 *  contradicts the stub — one decision, both inputs from the server.
 *
 *  `unlockedPresentationOnly` is the page's already-read presentation flag: a
 *  TRUE short-circuits the entitlement read, and anything else (false, or a
 *  caller that passes nothing) triggers a fresh read of this session's own rows.
 *  A negative is never trusted, because the page's flag is `false` while that
 *  read is still in flight — which is exactly when a buyer who has just paid
 *  clicks Fork. */
