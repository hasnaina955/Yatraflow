 * `fitScoreForPurpose` adds a populated-place bonus for meal / fuel /
 * overnight, which is exactly why a town can serve as lunch or a night halt.
 * That ambiguity is why a DNA event also records its own `haltKind` — category
 * alone cannot tell a town accepted as a night halt from one accepted as lunch.
