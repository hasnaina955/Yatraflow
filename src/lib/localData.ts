// ============ What this browser keeps, and how to clear it honestly ============
//
// The crash screen's "Reset app data & reload" removed `yatraflow_db_v1` — a key
// that **nothing in this codebase ever writes**. So the app's most destructive
// button removed nothing at all, while wearing the primary style and the promise
// of a reset. (It also inherited the name of a localStorage database this app no
// longer has: trips live in Supabase, and what is actually kept locally is
// preferences, caches and an offline copy.)
//
// This module is the one place that knows what "local app data" means, so the
// button can clear the real thing — and `tests/local-data.test.ts` reads the tree
// to keep the list honest: every `localStorage` key a module writes must sit under
// one of these prefixes, or the test says so.
//
// Prefixes rather than an enumeration: several keys are per-trip or per-day
// (`yatraflow_suggestions_v6_<tripId>`, `yatraflow_halt_shape_<tripId>`), so a
// list of literals would be stale the moment a trip is opened. The prefixes are
// narrow enough to be this app's alone.
