// The browser-tab title for each route.
//
// `index.html` carries one static title, so every route shared it: a traveller
// with four tabs open saw "YatraFlow — Plan real trips, together" four times,
// and a bookmark of a specific itinerary was indistinguishable from a bookmark
// of the site. The route is the only thing that changes, so the mapping lives
// here rather than inline in the shell.
//
// Pure and argument-taking, so it is testable without a router or a DOM. The
// route segments are passed already split (App.tsx splits them for the router
// anyway) and the `subject` — a trip name, an itinerary title, a creator's
// name — is supplied by whoever holds that data. App deliberately slices its
// store subscriptions, so it does not read the trips table just to title a tab;
// the page that already has the record refines the title itself.
