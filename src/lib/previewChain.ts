// ============ One preview at a time — chained, not forked (#334) ============
//
// The impact-preview sheet is NOT modal: the timeline, board and map stay live
// while it is open. Every mutation used to clone the COMMITTED trip, so a
// second edit made while a preview was open replaced the first one outright —
// the staged change vanished with no toast, no merge and no warning.
//
// The policy (Option A of the issue's fix guide) is to CHAIN: the base for a
// mutation is the staged proposal when one exists, so the second change builds
// on the first and the sheet reports the combined delta. The committed trip is
// still the measuring stick for the impact itself, which keeps the numbers
// honest about what Save will actually write.
//
// Kept pure and React-free so the composition is pinned in node tests
// (tests/preview-chain.test.ts); the workspace owns the state.
