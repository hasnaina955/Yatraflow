// ============ Sharing what you bought (ROADMAP I-21) ============
// Buyers are the distribution channel (research §4.5), so a purchase needs an
// artifact its owner will voluntarily circulate — and one place to produce it,
// because two surfaces offer it (the shelf, and the moment right after paying)
// and the fallback chain is the part that is easy to get inconsistent.
//
// The card itself is the SERVER's job: `api/i.js` renders the "I bought …"
// framing only when `owns_publication` confirms the entitlement is for that
// publication. This module just builds the address, hands it to the system
// share sheet, and falls back to the clipboard — the same share-then-copy shape
// ShareTab uses for a snapshot link.
//
// The web Share API being present or absent decides which path runs, not which
// link is produced: both carry the entitlement, so a copy pasted by hand
// previews exactly like a shared one.
