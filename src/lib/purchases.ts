// ============ What a buyer owns (ROADMAP I-20) ============
// Two surfaces read the same facts: the shelf ("My purchases") and the moment
// right after a purchase. Both are derived here rather than inline in the page
// so the rules that are easy to get quietly wrong — ordering, the update
// marker, a publication the buyer owns but cannot see any more, a doubled row
// — are pinned by the node suite.
//
// The pairing is deliberate: `entitlements` says what was PAID (the price
// snapshot, the date), `published_itineraries` says what the plan IS now
// (cover, length, places, when the creator last refreshed it). A shelf that
// reads only the first cannot show a cover; one that reads only the second
// cannot tell you what you paid or when.
