// Settlement math (M6 · B4) — the one part of the settle-up feature that is
// arithmetic rather than wiring, extracted from BudgetTab so it can carry unit
// tests (the store-action tests never reach this code). Pure: no store, no
// React, no dates — members in, balances and transfers out.
//
// Semantics (I-19 re-based the first one; the component and these tests moved
// with it):
//  - Fair share is the OPEN (unsettled) TAGGED lines split per head, and those
//    same lines credit whoever fronted them. Both sides come from one
//    population, so the balances net to zero and the settlement transfers
//    balance exactly. It used to be the whole trip estimate
//    (`totals.totalCostInr`), which made "mark settled" a pure record: the right
//    behaviour for a planner, the wrong one for settling up. The estimate still
//    lives in the Budget tab's metric strip, where a planning figure belongs.
//  - SETTLED lines are dropped in here rather than by the caller, so no call
//    site can quietly re-introduce them (the I-19 invariant, pinned by tests).
//  - Only lines TAGGED with a payer move a balance; untagged lines stay in the
//    shared kitty and move nobody — they are outside the fair share too.
//  - A per-person line is multiplied by the head count — whoever fronted it
//    paid for everyone — using the same floor of 1 as the division, so a
//    0/undefined head count cannot divide by zero.
//  - A payer who is not a member (stale row, removed crew member) credits
//    nobody: balances are computed over members only.
