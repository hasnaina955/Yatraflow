// ============ Stop order: one implementation of the day invariant ============
// The itinerary contract (src/lib/itinerarySpec.ts) is 1-based, CONTIGUOUS
// `orderInDay` per day. Four surfaces wrote orders independently — the store's
// stop mutators, the Timeline's delete/move handlers, the Map's fill, and the
// Board's own drop — and only the store renumbered: deleting a stop on the
// Timeline left `[1,3]`, the next add took `length + 1` = 3, and the day held
// two stops claiming position 3 (#337). A cross-day move that named no day
// spliced the source first and dropped the stop on the floor (#339).
//
// Every writer shares this module now, and it is pure — no store, no DOM — so
// the node-env suite can pin the rule the surfaces call.
