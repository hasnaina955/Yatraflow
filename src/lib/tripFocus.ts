/**
 * Shared selection/focus model (#425, PR 1 of 2).
 *
 * One identity a trip surface can examine: WHICH trip, WHICH day, optionally
 * WHICH stop / leg / suggestion. Timeline, Map and Board each hold local
 * selection state today and "selection" means something different on each;
 * this module is the canonical shape they will converge on. PR 1 lands the
 * contract + the Timeline bridge; Map/Board adoption is PR 2.
 *
 * Rules this module exists to keep (from the issue):
 * - Focus is EPHEMERAL UI state. It is never written into trip data, never
 *   persisted with the itinerary, and never handed to a provider/mutation.
 * - A one-shot focus REQUEST is validated against the trip it names before
 *   use, then consumed — a stale value can neither re-fire on a later mount
 *   nor leak across trips (the workspace outlives trips; the clock walk's
 *   drive-day numbers index past the itinerary).
 * - `null`/`undefined` focus is a valid, expected state (nothing examined),
 *   so every predicate treats "empty" as a distinct answer, never truthiness.
