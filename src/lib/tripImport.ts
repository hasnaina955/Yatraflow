// ============ Trip import ============
// One parser for every JSON a user can hand the app. The RULES live in
// `lib/itinerarySpec.ts` (shared with the exporter, the validator CLI and the
// authoring tool); this module is the file-shaped facade over them.
//
// Formats, and what happens to each:
//
//   v1  a bare `Trip`            — what older "Download JSON" wrote
//   v1  `{ trip, publication }`  — the pre-versioning gallery import format
//   v2  `{ formatVersion, trip }`— what this build writes (see snapshot.ts)
//
// Parsing is pure and side-effect free so it can be tested without a browser.
// Applying it is the store's job (`importTrip`).
//
// Two properties this module owes its caller:
//   1. It NEVER returns a trip the rest of the app cannot render — every stop
//      it keeps has usable coordinates, every number is a number, every day is
//      numbered from 1 and contiguous, and the date range matches the day count.
//   2. It SAYS what it changed. `report.repairs` is the compatibility story for
//      an older file; `report.warnings` and `report.droppedStops` are the parts
//      a person has to look at. Nothing is fixed or lost silently.
