/**
 * The trip card's derivations: its next-step line (MR1), its planning bar
 * (MR2), its status filter taxonomy (MR3) and its departure countdown (MR6).
 * Pure on purpose: no React, no store, no DOM, so each answer is testable on
 * its own and the card only reads them.
 *
 * The next-step order below is the finding, not a taste call. An unfilled day
 * blocks every later day, because the engine plans days in sequence. A booking
 * blocks the day that carries it. A suggestion blocks nothing, so it waits. A
 * cover photo blocks nothing at all, so it waits for last.
 *
 * An automatic route anchor is not an activity (#647). `autoAnchor` in the store
 * writes one stop at the origin and one at the last destination, each with zero
 * dwell time, so the route has a start and an end. The engine treats those stops
 * as waypoints (`src/lib/engine.ts`). A planning meter that counts them reports
 * progress a traveller does not have.
