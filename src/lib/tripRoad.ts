// ============ The trip's road measurement: one chain, one retry (#188) ============
// Every trip surface needs the SAME road chain. The workspace's leg corrections
// (budget, fatigue, warnings — every tab) and the Map tab's line, totals and
// suggestion corridor all describe one drive. Measuring it per surface doubled
// the load on the shared, rate-limited OSRM demo server (the very thing that
// caused #185's transient failures) and let the map draw a road the detour math
// could not see ("blue line present + 0 km off-route", #184).
//
// So the workspace owns exactly ONE measurement — `buildRoadChain` once, one
// `routePath` chain, one retry — and every surface derives from it:
//   · correctionsFromLegs   → the engine's leg corrections
//   · mapRoadViewFromLegs   → the Map tab's geometry / totals / per-day road km
//
// The chain is a SUPERSET of the Map tab's points (start + every stop, then the
// optional return-to-start and trailing destination), so the Map tab's legs are
// a strict prefix — `outboundCount` marks the split. Nothing here is React or
// I/O beyond the injected measure; it is all pure and node-testable.
