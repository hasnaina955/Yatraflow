// ============ Sending a published link on WhatsApp (ROADMAP F3 · #227) ============
// The distribution experiment is one message into a group the sender is
// already in, and the send unit is what this module owns: the address, the
// sentence, and the fallback chain. The CARD that lands at the other end is
// the server's job (api/i.js renders the publication's own Open Graph tags) —
// this only puts a good address in someone's hands.
//
// The fallback order is the one `lib/purchaseShare.ts` established: the
// system share sheet first (on a phone it lists WhatsApp directly, and the
// message is identical either way), then WhatsApp's own click-to-chat. Two
// rules from the crew-channels pass shape the second step:
//   - §6e — a window opened with the `noopener` feature ALWAYS returns null.
//     The moment-after screen's "Send invite" read that null as
//     popup-blocked and therefore never once opened WhatsApp. Nothing here
//     reads the return; the link also lands in the clipboard so a blocked
//     popup is still a usable share.
//   - §6a — the caller holds the button disabled while this resolves (the
//     #409 shelf pattern); this module is async and never throws.
