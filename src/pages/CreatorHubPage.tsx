// ============ Creator hub ============
// Standalone home for creator-account management, extracted from the old
// "Creator mode" + "My publications" cards in Profile. Reached from the gated
// "Creator hub" nav pill (and the Profile gateway card). Requires a creator
// account; non-creators see an enable call-to-action.
//
// SHAPE (2026-09-23): rebuilt as a working dashboard rather than a settings
// page. The page now leads with performance — one ruled KPI strip, then the
// recorded-traffic trend for the selected window — because "how are my
// publications doing" is the question a creator arrives with. The creator
// profile (bio, socials, the disable switch) moved into a disclosure at the
// foot: it is a thing you set once, and it used to hold the entire fold.
//
// The trend and the per-publication rows are ONE derivation over ONE clock
// (`now` is computed once and handed to both builders), so the chart can never
// describe a different window from the numbers beneath it.
