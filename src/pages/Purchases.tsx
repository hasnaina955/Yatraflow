// ============ My purchases (ROADMAP I-20) ============
// The shelf the research asks for: what you own, from whom, what you paid and
// whether its creator has touched it since. Ownership has to live somewhere
// visible — a bought plan that dissolves into the same list as your own trips
// reads as though it evaporated.
//
// Two deliberate choices, both about honesty:
//   * Entitlements are read here on mount rather than carried in the hydrate
//     cache (see lib/unlock.ts for why they stay out), and the read is the
//     STRICT one: a failed request must not render as "nothing bought yet",
//     which would tell a paying customer they own nothing.
//   * Every price shown is the entitlement's own snapshot, never the
//     publication's price today — a creator raising their price does not
//     retroactively change what you paid.
