-- RLS CONTRACT TEST — crew-facing policies (run in Dashboard → SQL editor)
-- ============================================================================
-- Verifies the policies an authenticated crew actually relies on, from the
-- management plane's own metadata (pg_policies / pg_proc / pg_publication).
-- Every probe is a DO-block assertion: it raises (and names the broken rule)
-- when the production shape drifts. A clean run prints exactly one row.
--
-- Covered:
--   1. trips            -- owner-scoped insert, editor-scoped update and
--                          delete, restrictive trashed-read (owner+editors
--                          still read tombstones)
--   2. trip_members     -- self-or-owner insert, owner update, owner-or-self
--                          delete, recursive-safe select (is_member definer)
--   3. child collab     -- suggestions / activity: editor-or-
--                          public read, editor write
--   4. notifications    -- recipient-only read, recipient-or-orchestrator write
--   5. published        -- public gallery read, creator-only write
--   6. trash wiring     -- per-user list/restore/purge RPCs re-check ownership,
--                          30-day sweep only via service_role, pg_cron schedule
--   7. capability RPCs  -- invite code / invite preview / published stats:
--                          security definer, granted to anon + authenticated
--   8. realtime         -- the collaboration layer is on supabase_realtime
--   9. trip touch       -- trips.updated_at is kept by the database (B2)
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================ 1. trips (v2)
-- Token-calibrated against live schema (2026-09-17): case-insensitive,
-- order-free matching; policy NAME is not asserted (pg_get_expr canonicalizes
