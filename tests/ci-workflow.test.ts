// CI workflow contract: the verification gate must run on the branches that
// feature work actually integrates through. Static source check — no browser.
//
// Why this exists: `ci.yml`'s `pull_request` trigger listed only `main`, which
// made `test` — the branch every feature reaches through a PR — the one
// destination where a green check list proved nothing. A PR into `test` ran
// Codacy and Vercel and no "Verify" job at all, and the gate only fired once the
// merge pushed to `test`, after the point where a red tree could still be
// refused. It was found on 2026-09-14 (PR #105) and documented in AGENTS.md
// §3.1, but prose is not a gate: nothing failed while the trigger was wrong, so
// the gap outlived the entry that described it. This test is that missing
// failure — an edit that drops a shared branch from the trigger, or that stops
// running the gate, now fails the build instead of silently weakening every
// future merge.
