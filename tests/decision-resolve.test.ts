// ============ #432 — a decision's resolution must be able to persist ============
//
// The bug this pins: `decisions.resolved_option_id` was declared **uuid** while
// option ids have always been text — `o_<uid()>` from `addDecision`, and
// `slot:<key>:<placeId>` from the Map rail's slot votes (load-bearing:
// `resolveDecision` parses the part back with `/^slot:([a-z]+):/`). So every
// resolve sent text into a uuid column, PostgREST answered 400 / 22P02, and
// `fire()` only console.error'd it: the UI said Resolved from the cache, the
// row stayed open, and the resolution vanished on the next load. Nothing in
// `tsc`, the node suite or the build ever sent the payload anywhere, which is
// why the whole gate stayed green.
//
// This file holds the three layers to each other — the column type, the
// migration that fixes a live database, and the payload the store writes — plus
// the reason no probe can answer for a type change (see NO_PROBE_SURFACE).
