// ============ Doc drift: a claim about the product's state, checked against the code ============
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A doc line in the future tense about shipped work is a defect
// class no gate could see. A sweep once found the monetisation plan still
// inventorying `Payment rail` and `Entitlements` as things that did not exist
// weeks after v0.61.0 shipped them, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` still promising what
// M7 had to add — and the *seed* of that drift was a code comment
// (`premiumPriceInr // placeholder for future payments`) that the plan quoted as
// its own evidence. Nothing in `tsc`, the node suite or the build reads prose.
//
// HOW IT WORKS, and why it fails CLOSED:
//
//   1. DISCOVERY. Every line of every live doc is scanned for an absence cue
//      ("does not exist", "unbuilt", "not wired", "still to come"…).
//   2. EVERY HIT MUST BE REGISTERED, with a reason it is still true today. A
//      new sentence fails the build until someone either fixes it or writes down
//      why it is true — which is the whole point: the M7 drift was not a wrong
//      sentence, it was an unexamined one.
//   3. A REGISTERED CLAIM MAY CARRY A MARKER: repo evidence that the thing now
//      exists. If the marker appears, the claim is a lie and the build fails.
//      This is the half that catches drift by itself — "there is no payouts
//      table" fails the moment a payouts migration lands.
//   4. A REGISTERED CLAIM THAT NO LONGER MATCHES ANY LINE ALSO FAILS, so the
//      registry cannot rot into a list of sentences nobody wrote any more.
//
// MAINTAINING IT: reword a registered sentence → update its `contains` in the
// same commit. Ship the thing → delete the entry and fix the doc. Neither is
// optional, and the failure message names which one you are in.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT POLICE: dated snapshots. A report with a status
// date plus a version baseline is the record of a decision, and rewriting it to
// agree with today is how this repo lost its evidence once already (AGENTS §9's
// cousin). Those files are exempt — but only while they still earn it by
// carrying a date, which is asserted below.
