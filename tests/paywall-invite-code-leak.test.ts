// ============ #351 — the paywall's invite-code bypass, pinned from both ends ==
//
// Confirmed LIVE on 2026-09-25 against the production project with three
// anonymous HTTP calls and no account:
//
//   1. `get_public_trip` (anon) stubbed the DAYS correctly for a non-buyer —
//      11 stops on a ₹199 publication — and then returned the rest of the trip
//      row anyway, `invite_code` included. Three of six publications handed
//      over a real 15-character code; two of them were priced.
//   2. `get_trip_by_invite_code` (anon) was `select t.* … where code = p_code`
//      with no premium gate, so that same caller traded the code for the full
//      plan: 4 days, ZERO stubbed stops, real descriptions and entry fees.
//
// A paywall with a second door is not a paywall. These tests hold both doors
// shut and are written so the OLD state fails them: the source invariants fail
// against a `select *`, and the behavioural ones fail against a store that
// passes the RPC row straight through to the cache.
//
// The migration half carries a trap worth its own test: BOTH
// 20260925_publication_soft_unpublish.sql (#350) and this fix replace
// `get_public_trip`, so whichever file sorts LAST is the definition a fresh
// database actually runs. A fix that dropped #350's gate on its way past would
// trade one live hole for another, so the ordering is asserted, not assumed.
