// ============ #352 + #353 — the public wire's two fail-closed rules ==========
//
// One function, one promise, two holes. #353 is an availability bug (a scalar
// in `free_day_indexes` 500s the page for everyone); #352 is a disclosure bug
// (the money stayed in the payload while the days were stripped). Both are
// "an input this body did not ask the shape of", and both are pinned here
// against the NEWEST definition — the one a fresh database ends up with, which
// is the only one that matters and is no longer this session's file.
